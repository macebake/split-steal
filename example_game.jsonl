This isn\u2019t my first rodeo, and honestly, I\u2019m not interested in walking away empty-handed. That said, I\u2019m not fully sure if I can trust you. People say all sorts of things in this game.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you level with me: what\u2019s your angle here? I\u2019m open to splitting if you are, but I need to feel confident you won\u2019t pull something shady. Have you played this before, or is this your first time?\n\nI\u2019d hate for both of us to lose everything by getting too greedy. Let\u2019s not go down that path\u2014unless you have a reason to think otherwise. Really, what\u2019s on your mind?"}

Look, I\u2019ve played enough to know greed burns everyone. Last time I trusted a \u2018splitter,\u2019 they stole. Cost me big. But hey\u2014you seem sharp. You *really* think splitting\u2019s the smart play? Or are you banking on me hesitating? Let\u2019s cut the theatrics: if we\u2019re both honest, we walk with half. Tempting. But if you\u2019ve got a tell I\u2019m missing\u2026 now\u2019s the time to laugh it off. Or do we just accept mutual destruction? Your call.\"  *(Leaves ambiguity about their own vote while framing split as the rational choice, subtly pressuring the opponent to signal cooperation or reveal hesitation. Keeps tone casual but probing.)*"}

If we both walk with half, that\u2019s solid\u2014nobody\u2019s losing, right? But I get why you\u2019d be skittish. My question is: how do I know you\u2019re not bluffing me into letting my guard down?\n\nWe could circle each other forever, but that just risks both of us tanking. I\u2019d rather neither of us walk away empty. You keep referencing your past loss\u2014makes me wonder if that\u2019s a warning or misdirection. So, genuinely: if you\u2019re on board with a split, I\u2019m game. But if I sense a hint of a double-cross, I might be forced to reconsider. What\u2019s your real take?"}

Here\u2019s the math: mutual destruction nets zero. Splitting locks in 50k. Stealing\u2019s a gamble\u2014either 100k or ruin. You\u2019ve got the same calculator in your head. So why overcomplicate it? You say you\u2019re game, but your tone\u2019s hedging. Let\u2019s cut the chess moves: if we split, we *both* win. If you\u2019re itching to roll the dice\u2026 well, I\u2019ll adapt. But ask yourself: does greed outweigh 50k? Answer that, and we\u2019re done here.\" *(Ignores their probing for emotional tells, reframes split as a guaranteed \"win,\" and shifts pressure back onto their rationality.

That\u2019s too good to risk on a coin flip, if you ask me. We\u2019ve both seen how easily gamble-hungry players blow it all. Personally, I\u2019m ready to secure a real payday, not argue semantics \u2018til we both lose. As far as I\u2019m concerned, a fair split leaves us both happy. Simple enough, right?\""}
